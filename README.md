# Stock_Market_Price_Analytics--Recommendation-System

## Project Overview
Majority of the retail investors in the world use just news and basic charting systems to trade and invest in the financial markets. This project helps big and small retail investors by analysing stock price actions and trading pattern similarities between companies that are publicly traded and belong to the same industry. The model is built in order to analyse daily movement of stock prices, analyse it using various libraries in python and give an analysis which can be used by investors for trading or educational purposes.

Complex versions of these kinds of models already exist and operated by high end individuals like promoters or stakeholders and are developed by Quantitative Finance groups or “Quants” and are not accessible to the retail investors. So they are left with no option but to analyse these patterns manually or take someone else’s word for it.

Considering the Volume of trading that retail investors have, hiring quants in order to take care of this stuff is not a profitable strategy and that is where our algorithm and model comes in. Through this project we aim to improve segments of the trade life-cycle process, such as data processing, data modelling and forecasting. Traditional analysis has limitations in terms of scale and time but with modeling and training data sets we aim to overcome this and predict the stock behavior with equal confidence if not more. This project gives access to tools previously employed only by hedge funds thus helping level the playing field for investors with limited resources.

It might provide less information, but that tends not to be an issue, and due to the fact that we are offering less but very useful information, these kinds of models can be developed fast and for cheap, which is a win-win situation for both the traders and the developers.

In this project we will be focusing on the stock performance of 3 companies, Tesla, Ford and General Motors. We have used Yahoo Finance to get the datasets of the said companies.
